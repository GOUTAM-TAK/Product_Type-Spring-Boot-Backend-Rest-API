 Write a spring boot REST application which will provide Create & Get operations for Product resource.

Product has the following attributes: 
•	ID (unique identifier for each product, auto generated by JPA, starts from 1)
•	Name (should not be blank)
•	Product Code (Unique string for each product, should not be blank)
•	Date of manufacturing (should not be blank)
•	Category (should be an Enum, example: Fashion, Electronics)

•	You can use any relational database to save resource.
•	Resource created using Create endpoint should be retrieved using Get.
•	Response codes should be as per REST guidelines.(201 for resource creation , 404 for not found , 200 for ok)
•	Error handling in case of failures.
•	Add the logic to avoid duplicate resource creation. (Check if the resource exists before creating a new one)
